# Setting up OpenAI API

To use the OpenAI API, follow the steps below:

1. Copy the code from the `main.py` file and open it in PyCharm or any Python-compatible IDE.

2. Go to [openai.com](https://openai.com) and sign in with your Google account.

3. Once signed in, navigate to your profile.

4. Click on "API Keys" to access your API keys.

5. Copy the API key and paste it into the code where specified.

6. Save the changes to the `main.py` file.

7. Ensure that you have available tokens to use the OpenAI API. If you have sufficient tokens, the bot will function as expected. However, if you run out of tokens, you will need to purchase more.

8. Run the code in your IDE to activate the bot and utilize its functionality.

That's it! You should now be able to use the OpenAI API with the provided code.
